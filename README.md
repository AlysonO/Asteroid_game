# Asteroid_game

An asteroid-like game i wrote in my Advanced Programming class. 
Not very pretty, not very cute but i did it (with a lot of help from the internet - s/o to StackOverflow) and i'm happy. 

(also, if you're not reading it there, all the files of the game are on my github github.com/AlysonO !)
